This is my personal  project Where you can read a light novel that the administrator chooses. You can view each page by presing the next button. Or you can go back with the previous button.

If you have access rights as an administrator, you can login.

## How it's Made:

This simple auth program is made using HTML, CSS, Express, Node.js, JavaScript, and Passport.

I created this simple application by creating an ejs file dedicated to reading a light novel. This file was all javascript, ejs and css. Users who come to view the manga/light novel can leave a comment on what they think should be changed by inputing their user posting name and their message.

All my other files are a standard OAuth program where the user can login, view posted messages, delete messages, or even post their own administrator messages. They can also create a new admin account.

## canceled additions:

If i had more time i would have implemented a way for administrators to upload their profile images, upload new content to be read, have users be able to thumbs up or down their comments, and have each user be able to have their own mini icon they can select from when posting their messages.
